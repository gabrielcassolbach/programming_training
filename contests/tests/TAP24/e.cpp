/* RASCUNHO

N weapons. Each weapon is associated with the values A, B, and C. 
Each attack invalidates the weapon, decreases the Hero power points (P) and 
damages the Beast C health points. 

if P >= 0 and C <= 0 at the end of the attack, the Hero wins. 

Output the maximum value of C that assures that the Hero can win.
