The first line contains two integers N and L, representing 
respectively the number of addresses in the system, and the 
number of addresses that are mailing lists. Addresses are 
identified by distinct integers from 1 to N. Addresses from 
1 to L are mailing lists, while the rest are client emails. 

-> For i in the range [1, L]:
K1 -> (2, 3). Mailing list with the addresses 2 and 3. 
K2 -> (4, 5). Mailing list with the addresses 4 and 5.
